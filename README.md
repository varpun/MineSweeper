# MineSweeper
Minesweeper Game

This game consists of a 8x8 grid with 10 mines. You can play this game via the console. 
This game is similar to the traditional minesweeper game. You need to mention the line and 
the column to unlock the particular cell. If you select a cell which has a mine then you lose the
game. At the end if you leave 10 cells unexplored which you think might contain the mine then you win the game.
